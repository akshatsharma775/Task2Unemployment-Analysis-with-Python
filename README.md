# OIBSIP Task2 Unemployment-Analysis-with-Python
Unemployment is a critical economic indicator that reflects the health of an economy. A rising unemployment rate often signals economic distress, while a declining rate may indicate economic growth. Governments, businesses, and policymakers use unemployment data to make informed decisions about resource allocation, policy-making, and strategic planning.

Objective:
The objective of this analysis is to investigate the trends, patterns, and determinants of unemployment rates over time and across different regions or demographic groups. Additionally, the project aims to develop predictive models to forecast future unemployment rates, which can help in proactive decision-making.
